# Text to Binary Convertor

Type some text in `text.txt` and run `textToBin.py`. This will overwrite `bin.txt` with the translation of your text. <br>
The same goes for `bin.txt`, `binToText.py` and `text.txt`.

Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged text.txt` and `git update-index --assume-unchanged bin.txt` to freeze git to the default values for the input output files. <br>
(This means that your IDE won't suggest that you commit your changes during use).
